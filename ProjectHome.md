OpenJSFShop is an e-commerce software that has been fully implemented in JSF. Primarily, the software should have all the functions that today bring other online shops.

In order to develop a possible maintainable and easily extensible software we use from the beginning to multiple layers, so as to obtain a clearly structured source code. For this we use for example for the database queries MyBatis.

In order to enable simple installation, we use Maven for dependency management. A simple configuration option we want to achieve through a clear admin interface, as well as an easy to understand installation script.

The development is currently at a very early stage of development and is currently operated by two developers.

The community is cordially invited to communicate their ideas and suggestions and thus actively participate in the development of the software. Once a working version is available, we will provide a demo page.
